#Building Inclusive Technologies

^This is important to me because 
^I’ve seen how discouraging exclusive technologies can be for users
important to literally just acknowledge through products that different types of people exist.
^IT’S HARD: I realize how time consuming, exhausting, overwhelming, and to be honest nearly impossible it is to make every single person feel included all the time
^So hopefully by the end of this talk I can provide a some words of encouragement and tips on how to do this better

^Having diverse teams is important and highly related to this topic. 
^I could talk about that for forever (and message me if you’d like to!) but I’m going to focus more on diverse consumers rather than producers
^I’m going to give some examples (some real, some hypothetical) of barriers that get built into technologies that isolate certain groups and talk about how we can be more inclusive
^And of course relate this all to Venmo

What do I mean making more inclusive technologies?

The fact is, you want as many people using your product as possible.

There's value in making other people feel good.

^"We are working with our partners to learn more. The technology we use is built on standard algorithms that measure the difference in intensity of contrast between the eyes and the upper cheek and nose. We believe that the camera might have difficulty "seeing" contrast in conditions where there is insufficient foreground lighting."
