#Building Inclusive Technologies

^This is important to me because 
^I’ve seen how discouraging exclusive technologies can be for users
important to literally just acknowledge through products that different types of people exist.
^IT’S HARD: I realize how time consuming, exhausting, overwhelming, and to be honest nearly impossible it is to make every single person feel included all the time
^So hopefully by the end of this talk I can provide a some words of encouragement and tips on how to do this better

^Having diverse teams is important and highly related to this topic. 
^I could talk about that for forever (and message me if you’d like to!) but I’m going to focus more on diverse consumers rather than producers
^I’m going to give some examples (some real, some hypothetical) of barriers that get built into technologies that isolate certain groups and talk about how we can be more inclusive
^And of course relate this all to Venmo

What do I mean making more inclusive technologies?

#Why?

---

The fact is, you want as many people using your product as possible. 

---

There's value in making other people feel good.
