# Talks

Presentations for some of my talks can be found here. They are markdown files which I run in <a href="http://decksetapp.com/">Deckset</a>. Since these are just the markdowns, they might look a little funny. (Also note that the lines that start with "^" are my presenter notes/not part of the visual slide.) 

"Talk Kanye" is just a test presentation. (Or is it??)

Contact me for speaking requests! I like talking.
