# Talks

Presentations for some of my talks can be found here. I run these files using <a href="http://decksetapp.com/">Deckset</a>. If you're not running these files in Deckset, they might look a little funny. Have no fear: that's why I also included PDF versions! Mwahaha. :dancer:

"Talk Kanye" is just a test presentation. (Or is it??)

**Contact me for speaking requests! I like talking.**
