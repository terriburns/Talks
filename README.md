# Talks

Iâ€™m plan on talking a lot. The docs I use for some of of my talks will be here, run using Deckset (which is why I can build these presentations as simple markdown files. Awesome). 

Note that "Talk Kanye" was just a test presentation. Partially for me to learn VIM/Markdown/Deckset in one go, mostly for me to have an excuse to google pictures of Kanye and Nori.
