#venmo developer api

###**using venmo to make your apps even better**

^special thanks to Cassidy Williams for helping me with this! You're a star.

---

using the developer api is super easy :smile: :+1:

---

there are three main ways to use the api:

1. payment links

2. REST api

3. OAuth

^Moving away from focusing on drop ins

---

let's talk about the first:<br>

#**payment links**

---

**so simple it's almost absurd**

---

let's talk about the second: <br>

#**REST api**

---

---

how great is this :exclamation::collision:

---

let's talk about the third: <br>

#**OAuth**

(Note that OAuth actually uses the REST api. We've come full circle.)

so fun! amirite! :dancer:

---

we also have a **sandbox** for you to use when testing payments so you don't go broke. that said, if for whatever reason you'd like to practice sending payments to **me** by all means be my guest!

---

(and as a side note)

we have drop ins for iOS and android

+ you can make use cURL requests to make payments with the api

^not most recommended way to use the api, but mentioning just in case
