#venmo developer api

###**using venmo to make your apps even better**

^special thanks to Cassidy Williams for helping me with this! You're great.
For those listening, if you don't understand, don't stress. It's going to be okay. I don't always understand everything. Ask questions!

---

using the developer api is super easy :smile: :+1:

---

there are **two** main ways to use the api:

1. payment links

2. REST api/OAuth

---

(and a third, just to note)

**three:** Drop ins for iOS and Android

HERE ARE SOME NOTES ABT THIS

^Moving away from focusing on "drop ins" aka the iOS and android SDKs (for now)

---

let's talk about the first:<br>

#**payment links**

---

---

**so simple it's almost absurd**

---

let's talk about the second: <br>

#**REST api/OAuth**

---

#**THE RULE**

in order to use the REST api with venmo, you must be implementing OAuth

BUT! you don't necessarily have to implement OAuth using the REST api

---

i know, i know. **squares** and **rectangles**

#using the REST api for OAuth

stuff

---

#using OAuth (without REST api)

---

stuff

so fun! amirite! :dancer:

---

we also have a **sandbox** for you to use when testing payments so you don't go broke. that said, if for whatever reason you'd like to practice sending payments to **me** by all means be my guest!

---

(and as another side note)

you can make use cURL requests to make payments with the api

```curl --data "access_token=INSERTHERE&user_id= INSERTHERE&note=AWESOME%20DEMO%TERRI&amount=0.01" https://api.venmo.com/v1/payments```

^not most recommended way to use the api, but mentioning just in case
