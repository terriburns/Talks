#Breadcrumbs

###iOS app by Kevin Cronley, Vicky Chen, and Terri Burns

---

###The app proposal:  Breadcrumbs is a map app that let's you navigate without data.

---

###What it does: When you are not connected to wifi or data, Breadcrumbs will allow you to sill use a map to navigate to get to where you need to go!

---

##Intended audience: People with limited access to data (people with limited funds, travelers, people with unreliable access to internet and data).  In general, the target demographic is people who, for various reasons, are regularly disconnected from data, but still need to use maps to get from point A to point B.

##Technical specifications (backend/resources):

- Initial location must be downloaded via data/wifi

- Apple map view will have overlaid directions on it

- Every designated time period (say, 10 mins), use the compass to direct to each point

- Use the google directions API to overlay directions

---

##Technical specifications (challenges)

- May not be able to get directions--> point to a previous point

- User may have to drop points in advance 

---

##Overall Logic 

- User can drop points on map when connected to data beforehand

- Once user is no longer connected to data, user can still find predetermined points

- Once user is no longer connected to data, user can still search for a new location, so long as it's in the specified location
