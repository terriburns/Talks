###Is an algorithm any less racist than a human?

"...any algorithm can – and often does – simply reproduce the biases inherent in its creator, in the data it’s using, or in society at large. For example, Google is more likely to advertise executive-level salaried positions to search engine users if it thinks the user is male... While Harvard researchers found that ads about arrest records were much more likely to appear alongside searches for names thought to belong to a black person versus a white person...

---

"These aren’t necessarily malicious situations – it’s not that Google is staffed by sexists, for example, but rather that the algorithm is just mirroring the existing gender pay gap. But in so doing, the algorithm reinforces that gap, and as long as we continue to believe an algorithm is an “unbiased” machine, we risk reinforcing the status quo in harmful ways."

Be cognizant of implicit bias...

... and how that Manifests in Code

(in other words, check your privilege)

The vast majority of us have privilege! For example...

- Please pay $5 to play this game.

- Please enter the college you attended to confirm your identity.

- Please enter your manager's contact info to verify your work history.

###Be Cognizant of Programming Bias

#### Emacs vs Vi/Vim

#### AngularJS vs React

#### Cassandra vs MongoDB

#### Server-side vs client-side

#### Java vs C++

and so on

###Diverse teams, companies, thoughts, backgrounds, music tastes, etc etc

###The Future of Computing - Building at Unprecedented Scale:

- Machine learning

- Big Data

- Web Services

- Security Infrastructure
